# Terminal Fighter: a simple River_Raid like gime in C

## Description

**Terminal Fighter** is a simple text-based fighting game developed as a final project for my **Basic Programming** course at university. Built entirely in **C**, the game runs in the terminal and features turn-based combat, ASCII art animations, and basic RPG elements like health management.

This project was my first major introduction to **programming**, **user input handling**, and **game logic design** in C. While basic, it was a fun way to apply core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Features  
- ⚔️ **Turn-based combat** against a computer-controlled opponent.  
- 🎮 **Keyboard-controlled actions** (attack, block, heal).  
- 🖥️ **ASCII art animations** for attacks and victory/defeat screens.  
- 📊 **Simple stat tracking** (health points, damage dealt).
